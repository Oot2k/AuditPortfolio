## Supporting roles (Judge)

Oot2k has been the lead judge in multiple audit contests.
In this role, they are responsible for creating the final report of all issues found during a bug bounty competition.
To do this well, judges need a strong understanding of the system or protocol being tested so they can decide which issues should be included in the report for the client.

## Glossary

### Security contests
Cybersecurity contests are conducted on live code or code that is about to be released.  
These competitions are mostly open to the public, where anyone can submit potential vulnerabilities to the development team behind the codebase.  
Contests are a great form of audit because more people are looking at the code.

### Judge
A judge on a bug bounty platform is someone who reviews security reports submitted by participants, verifies whether the issues are valid, and decides their severity and relevance. They ensure only accurate, impactful findings are included in the final results for the client.
